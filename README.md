## 🧠 What I Learned

During the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Python lists**: to store and manage dynamic data
- **Functions**: for organizing code into reusable blocks
- **Conditional statements**: for decision-making based on user input
- **Loops (while, for, enumerate)**: for repeatedly displaying the menu and iterating over tasks
- **User input handling**: using `input()` and simple validations

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. When you run the script, a menu is displayed with options to Add, View, Delete tasks, or Exit.
2. The user selects an option by typing a number (1-4).
3. Based on the input:
   - A task is added to the list
   - All tasks are displayed with numbers
   - A task is deleted by choosing its number from the list
4. The loop continues until the user chooses to exit.
